Knives out is written and directed by Rian Johnson and is a whodunnit murder mystery about a patriarch who dies at the age of 85 due to what seems like a suicide. I just saw this film last night and I really loved it. I thought the movie was incredibly well written. Rian Johnson finds a way to tell a fresh story in this over saturated genre, where we have already seen most of the tropes played out. The story was very engaging and had me at the edge of my seat throughout the runtime. The pacing was perfect and I canâ€™t imagine anyone getting bored watching this. It was also incredibly funny, probably the funniest film I have scene the entire year. It has a humongous cast, and everyone did such a great job with their characters, especially Daniel Craig who steals every scene he is in. As per the flaws, I felt that the second half of the film wasnâ€™t as interesting then the first . It was still very good, just not as good as what came before. I was also slightly underwhelmed by the final reveal, I expected something more unexpected ðŸ˜…. But overall, I thought it was a great film and I highly recommend watching it. I will give Knives Out an 8/10
