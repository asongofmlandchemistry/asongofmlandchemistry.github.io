Hi guys, Today's blog will be a little different from my other blogs, today we won't learn how to do something cool with neural nets, but instead we will see what makes Neural Networks so great for machine learning problems. This post is for the people who know what neural nets are but find it difficult to understand why they work so well. I will take an example of binary classification to demonstrate how neural nets are able to approximate highly complex functions accurately. So lets dive into the details, its going to be fun.
